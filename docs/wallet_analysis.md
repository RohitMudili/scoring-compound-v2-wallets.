# Wallet Behavior Analysis

## Overview

This analysis examines the characteristics and patterns of the highest and lowest scoring wallets in the Compound V2 protocol, based on our behavioral scoring methodology. The analysis reveals clear patterns that differentiate successful and potentially problematic protocol interactions.

## Top Performing Wallets

### Common Characteristics
1. **Consistent Activity**
   - Regular deposit patterns with low timing variance
   - Optimal frequency of 2-4 deposits per month
   - Long-term engagement (6+ months)

2. **Value Stability**
   - Moderate to large deposit sizes ($1,000 - $5,000)
   - Consistent deposit amounts with low variance
   - Steady increase in total value locked

3. **Asset Diversity**
   - Usage of multiple supported assets
   - Balanced distribution across asset types
   - Strategic asset allocation patterns

### Representative Examples
1. **Wallet A**: Score 92.5
   - 8-month activity span
   - 24 deposits averaging $2,500
   - Uses 4 different assets
   - Extremely consistent monthly deposits

2. **Wallet B**: Score 89.3

   - Highly variable deposit amounts
   - Extremely small or unusually large deposits
   - No clear value strategy

3. **Limited Asset Usage**

   - Erratic timing patterns

2. **Wallet Y**: Score 15.4
   - 1-month activity span

   - Stable value contributions
   - Regular but not excessive activity

2. **Risk Indicators**
   - Extremely short activity periods
   - Over-concentration in single assets
   - Erratic deposit patterns
   - Unusual value distributions

3. **Protocol Implications**
   - High-scoring wallets contribute to protocol stability
   - Low-scoring wallets may indicate speculative behavior
   - Behavioral patterns correlate with protocol health
   - Clear differentiation between retail and professional usage
